# Diabetes Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on certain health parameters. The project utilizes various ML techniques to analyze and classify the data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and scales the data for better model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies significant features contributing to diabetes prediction.
- **Model Training**: Implements and compares multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for model assessment.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Dataset
The project uses a public diabetes dataset available from [link to dataset if available]. It contains features such as:
- Age
- BMI
- Blood Pressure
- Glucose Levels
- Insulin Levels
- Other relevant medical details

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
